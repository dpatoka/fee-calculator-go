## Task
### Objective
Build a CLI-based fee calculator demonstrating OOP, SOLID principles, design patterns, and clean architecture.

### Requirements
**Business Rules:**
1. Non-formulaic Structure: The fee calculation doesn't follow a mathematical formula - it's based on discrete breakpoints
2. Linear Interpolation: For amounts between breakpoints, interpolate linearly between the lower and upper bounds
3. Rounding Rule: Round the fee UP to ensure (amount + fee) is exactly divisible by 5
4. Amount Constraints:
    - Minimum: 1,000
    - Maximum: 20,000
    - Precision: up to 2 decimal places
5. Duration Options: Only 12 or 24 units are valid
6. Flexible Structure: The system should support changing:
    - Number of breakpoints
    - Breakpoint values
    - Storage mechanism
7. Rate Variation: The same fee may apply to different amounts (non-linear progression)

**Input:**
- Amount (decimal, 2 places)
- Duration period (integer: 12 or 24 units)

**Output:**
- Calculated fee based on predefined breakpoints
- Fee must be rounded so total (amount + fee) is divisible by 5
- Format: decimal with 2 places (e.g., `1223.44`)

**Technical Constraints:**
- CLI implementation: `calculate [amount] [period]`
- Exit code 0 on success, non-zero on failure
- Output to stdout, errors to stderr
- No web frameworks required

### Test Cases

| Amount    | Period | Expected Fee |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| 11,500.00 | 24     | 460.00       |
| 19,250.00 | 12     | 385.00       |

## Solution
### Run-it
#### On Linux
Build
```bash

go build -o loans cmd/loans/main.go
```

Execute with parameters `amount` and `term`, e.g.:
```bash
./loans -amount=1000 -term=12
```

### Architecture
- I've done this project with a `Modular Monolith` approach.
   - It's a good start that opens a clear path into decomposition to `Microservices`.
   - Of course, decomposition should be done only when needed.
- I follow `Ports and Adapters`, `DDD` and `CQRS` (only query needed here).
- When a Module needs to follow other architectural patterns, it's not blocked.
   - Not every Module needs `CQRS`, `DDD`, etc. Those are only tools to solve problems.
      - For example, patterns like `Pipe and filters` have also their place and can be used within `Modular Monolith`.
- Module entry point is the `Interface` layer.

### Calculation logic
- `BreakpointRange` - contains calculation logic:
   - The class has a single, cohesive responsibility.
   - The calculations are tied to the concept of breakpoint range.
   - According to `DDD`, classes should be rich in behaviour and not anaemic data containers.
- There is no requirement for making different calculations strategies possible.
   - When needed, the algorithm can be easily extracted and encapsulated with `Strategy Pattern`.
   - Now it's not needed, so I'm following `YAGNI` and `KISS`.
      - Not overengineering is a virtue for me.
   - It will be easy to evolve the solution:
      - I prefer `Emerging Architecture` and iterative problem-solving
      - Those can be done thanks to `SOLID` code and good tests.
         - Code should be flexible as clay and not be brittle as a stone.


### Testing Strategy
- For me tests are a design tool, living documentation and safety net (regression testing). I do `TDD` and `BDD` 🙂.
   - They help me to split a problem into smaller ones and resolve them one by one.
- I like the [Detroit TDD school](https://zone84.tech/architecture/london-and-detroit-schools-of-unit-tests/) (Kent Beck's) so:
   - Unit under tests is not the method or the class. It's the feature with the stable interface.
   - My `unit tests` are [sociable](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html).
   - I use mocks for cutting off:
      - heavy dependencies - to be able to test only part of the huge process,
      - outer-world dependencies - things I have no control.
   - Given all of that, here I don't use mocks.
- The Outcomes of such an approach are:
   - Tests check business behavior over implementation.
   - Tests are more stable against refactoring so encourage continuous improvements.
   - Tests are high quality code which documents and explains the behaviour of code.
   - In result: tests help to ship new features faster.
